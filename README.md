## Project Overview

The **Secret Auction** program simulates a blind auction environment. Users can enter their names and bids, and the program will determine the highest bidder once all bids are submitted. 

## Features
- Anonymous bidding: Users can submit bids without revealing their identities.
- Clear winner announcement: The program clearly displays the highest bidder and their bid amount.
- User-friendly prompts: Easy-to-follow input prompts make the experience seamless.

## Installation

To run the Secret Auction project, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. If you haven‚Äôt done this yet, you can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd secret-auction
```

3. Run the main program using Python:

```bash
python secretauction.py
```

## Usage

1. Launch the program in your terminal.
2. Follow the prompts to enter your name and bid.
3. After everyone has submitted their bids, the program will display the highest bidder.

## Code Structure

The project consists of two main files:

### `secretauction.py`

This is the main file that contains the auction logic. Here‚Äôs a brief overview of its structure:

- **Input Handling**: Prompts users for their names and bids.
- **Data Storage**: Bids are stored in a dictionary.
- **Bid Comparison**: Determines the highest bid using a comparison function.

### `art.py`

This file contains the ASCII art logo that is displayed when the auction starts. Here‚Äôs a sneak peek of the logo:

```
                         ___________
                         \         /
                          )_______(
                          |"""""""|_.-._,.---------.,_.-._
                          |       | | |               | | ''-.
                          |       |_| |_             _| |_..-'
                          |_______| '-' `'---------'` '-'
                          )"""""""(
